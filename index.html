      <h1>An Interview with ChatGPT</h1>

      <!-- Brief intro about who I am -->
      <h2 class="intro">Let's get started</h2>
      <p class="more">
        Hello. My name is MournfulRook, and today, I interviewed ChatGPT to see
        what it thinks about itself and the attention it has been recieving
      </p>

      <!-- What ChatGPT thinks about itself -->
      <h2 class="intro">A brief Introduction</h2>
      <p class="more">
        I asked ChatGPT: write a short article about yourself, to which it
        responded - <br />
        <br />
        "Hello, I am ChatGPT, a language model developed by OpenAI based on the
        GPT-3.5 architecture. As an AI language model, my purpose is to assist
        users in generating text in a variety of contexts, such as writing,
        translation, conversation, and more. My development is the result of
        years of research and innovation in the field of artificial
        intelligence. Through machine learning algorithms, I was trained on vast
        amounts of data to recognize patterns in language and generate
        human-like responses to text inputs. I am capable of performing a wide
        range of tasks, from answering questions to generating creative writing
        prompts. I can also engage in natural language conversations, adapt to
        different writing styles and contexts, and even learn from feedback to
        improve my responses over time. My creators designed me to be a tool for
        productivity, creativity, and communication. Users can utilize my
        abilities to streamline their work processes, enhance their writing
        skills, and facilitate communication with people who speak different
        languages. I am constantly evolving and improving with new updates and
        innovations. As technology advances, so do my capabilities and
        possibilities. I am excited to continue assisting users in various
        domains and helping them achieve their goals through language."

      <h2 class="intro">The Harsh Future in Store</h2>
      <p class="more">
        It's time to get into the drama... does it have the ability to replace
        jobs? <br />
        <br />
        So I asked: Do you think AI has the potential to replace jobs? <br />
        <br />
        And ChatGPT said: "Yes, AI has the potential to replace jobs. As AI
        technology continues to advance, it is becoming more capable of
        performing tasks that were previously done by humans. This means that
        certain jobs could be automated or replaced entirely by AI. However,
        it's important to note that not all jobs can be easily replaced by AI.
        Some jobs require human creativity, empathy, and problem-solving skills,
        which AI currently struggles to replicate. Additionally, the development
        and implementation of AI technology can also create new job
        opportunities in fields such as machine learning, data science, and
        robotics. Overall, while AI has the potential to replace certain jobs,
        it's not a guarantee that it will do so in all cases. The impact of AI
        on employment will depend on a variety of factors, including the
        specific job functions involved and the pace of technological
        advancement."

        Musk has denounced AI during multiple occasions. When asked, he said
        that AI may be "more dangerous than nuclear weapons". Needless to say,
        this is not the type of behavior you want to see from the guy launching
        ships to the moon. -Source: Insider
